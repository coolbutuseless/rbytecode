# Summary

Modern R now executes most code in a stack-based virtual machine (VM).

The *bytecode* which runs on the VM has until now mostly been hidden.

This book, and the `{rbytecode}` package are an exploration of this *bytecode*
and regular users now have the tools to inspect and understand what their 
code is doing at the lowest level of R.
