# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a book about the bytecode which drives the virtual machine at the
heart of R code execution.

R is a tricky beast.   

It never ceases to amaze and anger me with its funky syntax, weird errors,
expressive vector syntax, meta-programming, functional leanings and all
manner of pearls and warts.

I (weirdly) enjoy the process of understanding R.  I like breaking it to 
see how it works, and doing cool (but useless) things with it - purely 
for the fun in doing so.

This book represents my current (and still evolving) understanding of bytecode, 
and I hope to use this understanding to break R in new and exciting ways.
